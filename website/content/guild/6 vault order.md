Under Construction


To be able to provide maximum utility and efficiency on guild services we have Guild Vault Order (GVO) which described in detail in this chapter.

Guild Vault could only be used for 80 level items. It may look complicated at first glance but its actually fairly simple even could fit in integrity intuitively.


1- Grid Coordinates of Guild Vault

We are using a coordinate system to define locations in GV.

Indication: [columb range (1-14), row range (1-7)]

For instance in given example Infinite Dust locations are = [13-14, 1-6]



2- Stacking Order

Stacking starts with left-top corner and continues by filling each row on bottom direction.

3- Overstock

If the designated stock area is already full please don't load any more of specified item. If it has tier-II craftable variation (for example frostbolt of frostweave) could be turned.
