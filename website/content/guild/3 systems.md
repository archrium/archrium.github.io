### Loot System
- **Pug** Nothing Reserved
- **Pug** MS > OS Raid Roll & Stat Priority
- **Pug** Need boss item for trade purposes is reason to ban
- **Semi-Guild** 50%+> MS > OS & Stat Priority with EP gain
- **Guild** [EPGP](http://www.epgpweb.com/help/system)

We use the standard MS>OS Raid Roll system for loot with a small improvement, for each item you acquired in our runs your next roll number will be decreased by 10 points in order to be able to distribute loot more justly. This condition is unique for each raid.

### Schedule


There are no scheduled raids currently.
