### Do not ever play as clicker

Our spatial awareness and mobility are lessened by having to look at your bars as opposed to performing a muscle memory based rotation and paying full attention to fight mechanics. Furthermore, your ability to react to things off of the GCD (immunities, interrupts, et cetera) is lower, especially if there's travel time involved with the cursor. [quoted from Reddit user necis_]  


### Use more keybindings as much as possible

This advice is a supporter of the former. Try to add keybindings to every action bar button you have. At first, you may find it hard or inefficient way to use your skills but as long as you push yourself to use them you will build up a muscle memory. Eventually, you will find yourself using your bindings in the fastest way unconsciously.


### Use tracking/reminder add-ons

During raid fights too many information flowing out through your window most of the time, you will not be able to track all of them. For being able to keep your skill priority, buffs or warnings those reminder addons will help you and significantly increase your general performance.


### Use macros

Macros are little scripts to help you for simplifying repetitive tasks or conditional situations. Also will free few buttons of your actions bar. Even if you don't know how to write your own macros you can use our macro library and by altering them create your owns. Its also highly recommended to learn writing a macro.


### Optimize your UI

Default UI is sadly not very efficient on tracking information flow when it comes to raids. For example while your health bar stands left corner of the window, your buffs are on top-right corner while your awareness focused on middle during encounter.. Its advised to optimize valuable information fields within your focal point on screen via UI add-ons such as MoveAnything. This will help you to track information more smoothly as less eye movement your perception will increase significantly during raid encounters.


### Be a progressive researcher

Always check for alternative guides or other people for your class to be able to increase your performance. If you don't do that and focus only one way of thinking you may never able to realize your mistakes.


### Be online on Network

The power of the Guild comes from it's capability on organizing people; to be able to organize properly we need a decent communication network. In our case its Discord. Along with its voice comms function, we use it's text role mention ability to notify people about events. Unlike ingame chat there is no chance to miss Discord message since its permanent. Even if you were afk or on another window you will see its notification or saw it when you come back in front of your screen. Plus if you have compatible phone for Discord, you'll be informed anywhere anytime as long as you carry your phone with you or if you don't want to be distracted you can simply disable notifications for desired time.
